# Stats are weird. You don't want to push your current/ max level past 100 because game isn't meant to be, but you can max your your luck to 999 at lvl 1. Unsure if it increases past that, don't see a point as that plus the stacking fights multiplies your drop rate so 999 is really all you need. Strength and Defense at 255 should be all you need but the person who helped me figure most of tis out stated they pushed these to the thousands but again, I don't see a reason to.

# Sync is a percentage! For Shiki, I have her sync set to 300% currently on my file. This value shows up as B8 0B in the file, and the decimal value is 3000, so keep that in mind when changing sync%. 

# Bravery is weird. The in game values at base level for each character are as follows: Neku=15, Shiki= 110, Joshua= 40, Beat=5. This is because their bravery is calculated as stat + (max level -1). In my file I was level 95, and her Bravery was at 204. In the file, her bravery showed up as 110. Beat's was 5 and Joshua's was 40. I recommend setting the value for their bravery as whatever you want the end result to be - 99 (for the leveling).

# Pins in your Stockpile are stored in the string XX XX YY 00 ZZ, Where XX is the pin's Hex id in little endian [so Pin 269 (Cure Drink)-1= 268 which in hex is 10C, but i the save file shows up as 0C 01], YY is the Pin's Level ( you can set this to whatever you like, if you set it to the pin's max level all you have to do is equip it and it'll be maxed out), and ZZ is the quantity (but You shouldn't change it as you can't have a stack of unmastered pins. or try it idk, I didn't risk it) 
# Stockpile is weird in that it is diagonal in the hex file, so where the first item in your stockpile is at 0x0137. the second pin is at 0x0146, and the third is on 0x0155 and so on. keep that in mind when editing a fresh file.


Start of Stockpile: 

0x00000137

End of Stockpile:

0x00000B7C
# (End of stockpile needs testing)



# Pins in your mastered Bank are stored in XX XX YY 00 RR RR 00 00 00 ZZ , Where XX XX is the pin's # -1 then converted to hex in little endian, YY is the level of the Pin (all pins here should be maxed out), RR RR is numbers that are random ( I just don't know what they're for and they don't seem to be stat related), and ZZ is how many you have. 
# The 500 Yen Pin is the first pin my save file received in the mastered bank (you receive it in the first fights, and you can't equip your current pins when you receive it so it is the first according to your save file). The  number for the 500 yen pin is 251 so minus 1 gives us 250. In little endian hex it looks like FA 00, it's max level is 2, and I currently have 99 of it which in hex is 63. The string for it in my save file looks like FA 00 02 00 01 00 00 00 00 63


Start of Mastered Bank:

0x00001037

End of Mastered Bank:

0x00001E16
# End of Mastered Bank: Can confirm,  your stockpile ends at 0x00001E16 if you have all 323 pins, even if you have all of them at 99

# Money is in addresses 

# 0x0000004C to 0x0000004E

#Update 7/15/2021 

Moved to new Notes file, 

# Addresses for items starts at 0x00003CF7 and ends at 0x00004794, items are written in  01/00 XX XX YY where XX XX is the hex for the item, and YY is quantity. 00/01 could be a signifier if the ability is unlocked however, I believe there is a check elsewhere I haven;t found yet because sometimes the ability won't unlock in game if you do not have the necessary FSG maxed


# address for all threads starts at 0x00003CF7 and ends at 0x0000426C
# address for all food starts at 0x0000426F and ends at 0x00004343

# IMPORTANT NOTE! ALL ADDRESSES ARE MENTIONED ASSUMING THEIR FORMAT AS MENTIONED ABOVE! SO WHEN I REFER TO PIN MASTERY STARTING AT 0x00001037, THAT MEANS AT 0x00001037 THE HEX GOES 06 00 04 00 01 00 00 00 00 63, WHEN i HAVE 99 (63) SEXY+ (06 00) PINS MASTERED (MAX LEVEL IS 4= MASTERED= 04), ITEMS LIKE FOOD SHOW 01 4A 4E 63 00 WHEN I HAVE 99 (63) GOURMET RICE BALL (4A 4E) AT ADDRESS 0x00004340 TO 0x00004344.
