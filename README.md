# Hi, as you can see still working on making the actual save editor. I have never done any coding so this is my first project, any help/ suggestions would be appreciated. 

# To do: 
1. Locate health value
2. compile all writeable addresses within pins bank
3. do the same for threads
4. Find if multiple equipped pin decks show up in hex, write down addresses
5. find location of equipped threads
6. find location of equipped food. 
7. Create Gui
8. TBD


# Future Plans:
trying to make something like the wonderful Xenoblade Chronicles 2 save editor by damysteryman and the comprehensive Kingdom save editor by Xeeynamo. 

If I can get that done eventually, then it is very possible for a TWEWY Randomizer to be made. Goals would be unloclking A  New day by defeating all 3 mission noise, you'd start with the base pins, the chapter menu, basic abilities like dash, and go from there. route out where to go to grind for those mission noise to unlock and beat a New day. Extras would be getting the secret ending. Once I move past the save editor I want to take a look at flags in game to see if it'll be possible to edit rewards and get things going. All I know is that it should be possible as the debug menu found in the DS versions has values for the areas and such.
